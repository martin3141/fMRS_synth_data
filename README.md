# Code repository for the fMRS synthetic data working group 

We provide example code, initally for sharing ideas within the group, with potential for more widespread use in the future. The structure and purpose of this repository is liable to change over time.

Initial examples are written for the spant MRS analysis package. Installation instructions are available here : https://github.com/martin3141/spant
